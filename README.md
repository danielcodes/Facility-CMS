# Facility-CMS - check out demo [here](http://danielcodes.github.io/facility-CMS/)

### What is this?
A small one page CRUD application that I worked over the Summer of 2015. It was my first dive at web development and a great learning experience, lot of the stuff I used in the page are thanks to tutorials from [LearnCode.academy](https://www.youtube.com/user/learncodeacademy). Mostly the JQuery section, where I learned to use interactions and create AJAX calls to update content on the page.

### The concept
The idea of the project was, as the title says, content management. Since I worked for the facilities department over the summer, I was tasked with creating a system that allowed quick access to building information. The goal was insert __nodes__ on top of a floor plan, each of those nodes would be placed atop a room and display some information (either visual or text).
